# Katas

Kata (型 or 形 literally: "form"), a Japanese word, are detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata)

In programming, Katas are used to practice different programming patterns in the same way that martial artists do, through constant repetition and practice.
